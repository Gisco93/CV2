\subsection{Stereo Likelihood (10 Points)}
\setcounter{subsubsection}{2}
Everything else is in code.
\subsubsection{1 Point}
For the likelihood we need multiply the probability of each pixel. If we now assume a Gaussian and we are sampling
for an almost optimal case. We could assume the following equation:
$$max\mathcal{N}(0, 1)^{384\cdot288} \approx 0.4^{384\cdot288} \approx  0$$
For the negative log likelihood we would not multiply numbers $|n|<1$ and herefore again something signifcant bigger than 0.
\setcounter{subsubsection}{5}
\subsubsection{1 Point}
We calculate the negative log likelihoods for the Gaussian and Laplacian without the scaling term  and compute the increasing factor from 0\% noise. Both Models are not really robust, but the Laplacian seems to be less effected by outliers than the Gaussian.\\
