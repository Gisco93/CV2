\subsection{Stereo with gradient-based optimization (17 Points)}
Everything else is in code.
\subsubsection{4 Points}
When initailized with a constant disparity map the struggels to find another map which does not increase the function value as the prior increases in absolut value. It therefore only detects the edges and textures. The rest stays almost constant. It looks there a bit grainy.\\
The random disparity does not converge to something meaningful as its to far away from such a solution, as neighbouring pixels are incompatible. Therefore we area left with a grainy  disparity in area, where the disparities ar too incompatible to each other.\\
The ground truth converges to something  smoother than the orignal, but is left with some artifacts(face).\\
